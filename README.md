# Overview

This project is called the 'Console Task Manager'. I built it to really get hands-on with the Kotlin language, which is super useful for building apps today. As a developer, I need to know how to manage data and make sure my apps run smoothly, so this was perfect practice.

The app is just a simple menu that runs in the terminal. You can type in numbers to 'add', 'view', 'mark as complete', or 'delete' tasks from your list.

My main goal here was hitting the module requirements: I needed to show I could build my own data structure (a 'Class'), use a list that can be changed (Collections), and handle the menu using Kotlin’s cool 'when' expression.

# Development Environment

Here are the tools I used to build the app:
* Programming Language: Kotlin.
* Environment: It runs using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* IDE: I used IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, which is what Kotlin likes best.
* Version Control: Git, hosted on GitHub.

# Useful Websites

- Kotlin's main website (super helpful for docs)
- A tutorial on how Kotlin manages lists (for the collections requirement)
- The IntelliJ documentation (for setting up the project)

# Future Work

If I had more time to work on this, here’s what I’d change or add:

- Stop losing all the data! Right now, when you close the app, everything disappears. I'd add a way to save the task list to a file.
- Make the user experience smoother. The error messages are kind of abrupt. I'd make them friendlier and guide the user back to the menu better.
- Add a filter option. It would be nice to filter the list to only see tasks that are finished or only tasks that are pending.
